        <p>My favourite character in the whole wide world is BTS.They are the most famous K-pop Boy Band in the entire world and also the most richest.It's not the reason I love them JUST beacuse they are famous and rich, but because they tell people how to Love Yourself, how to Speak Yourself, how to Live your dreams Not others'.So, that's the reason I love them dearly.They are the best.Another reason I, well not I all ARMIES(Their fandom is named ARMY)love them because of their visuals.Well they are Handsome, no like really really Handsome and Cute, I mean really cute.So thse atre the reasons the other ARMIES and I love them very very very much.
